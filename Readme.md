# Artificial Intelligence (Semester 5 - Computer Science Engineering, AI & ML)

This repository contains various practical programs implemented as part of the Artificial Intelligence course (Semester 5) in the Computer Science Engineering (AI & ML) curriculum at the University of Mumbai. The programs are written in Prolog and Python, demonstrating key AI concepts such as logic programming, search algorithms, and Bayesian inference.

## Introduction

This repository showcases artificial intelligence programs covering topics like Prolog-based logic programming, search algorithms (uninformed and informed), expert systems, and probabilistic reasoning. The practicals are implemented in both Prolog and Python, making use of Prolog for symbolic logic-based AI and Python for algorithmic solutions.

## Programs Included

The repository contains the following practical programs:

1. **Prolog Programs**: Facts and rules, family tree, if-then logic, minimum-maximum number, series/parallel resistance calculation.
2. **First-Order Predicate Logic (FOPL)**: Implementation using Prolog.
3. **Mini Expert System**: Vacuum cleaner problem using Prolog.
4. **Hill Climbing Algorithm**: Travelling salesperson problem.
5. **A* Algorithm**: Informed search for the 8-puzzle problem.
6. **BFS-DFS Graph Traversal**: Water jug problem.
7. **Adversarial Search Algorithm**: Tic-tac-toe game.
8. **Bayesian Belief Network**: Solving the Monty Hall problem.

## Prerequisites

To run these programs, you'll need:

- **SWI-Prolog** (for Prolog programs) or any other compatible Prolog interpreter.
- **Python 3.x** for Python-based algorithms.
- Basic knowledge of artificial intelligence concepts, logic programming, and search algorithms.

## How to Run

### Running Prolog Programs:

1. **Install SWI-Prolog:**
   - Download and install SWI-Prolog from [https://www.swi-prolog.org](https://www.swi-prolog.org).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DevadattaP/Artificial-Intelligence.git
   cd Artificial-Intelligence/Prolog
    ```
3. **Open the Prolog File:**
    - Launch SWI-Prolog, then open the Prolog file:
    ```sh
    swipl
    ?- consult('filename.pl').
    ```
4. **Run the Queries:**
    - Execute queries based on the program by entering them in the Prolog interpreter.

### Running Python Programs:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Practicals.git
    cd AI-Practicals/python
    ```
2. **Run the Python Programs:**
   ```sh
   python filename.py
    ```
